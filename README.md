# Udacity Feedreader Testing Project by Tom McGinty

With this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. To complete the project I used [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test various functionality of the feed reader app.


## To run the project

Download or clone the repository to your local drive. Unzip the file. In the frontend-nanodegree-feedreader folder open the index.html file.
The tests are displayed at the bottom of the page. Click the menu icon to change feeds.

## Dependancies

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Coda).
* [Jasmine 2.1.2](https://jasmine.github.io/).
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* Jquery


## TODO

Currently I am not able link to the test on Github pages. This is due to the fact that Github pages run over https, but the original source code links Google fonts and Jquerry over http and causes an error. I did not want to change the original source code until the project passed.
